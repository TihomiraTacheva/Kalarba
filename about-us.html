        <p>Have you ever wonder how we get our team names and what does they mean? Well we looked it up.</p>

        <p>It appears that our team-name: Kalabra, comes from Star Wars, a pleasant and largely undeveloped world, and we are it's inhabitans or if we stick to the story: a native vynock.</p>

        <p>And what is a Vynock.Vynocks were leathery, winged creatures covered in small tentacles. They had no arms or legs, and scoured the rocky mountains of Kalarba for metals to eat. They would also terrorize settlements by infesting buildings, starships, and structures as well as tormenting livestock and other beings(like the lecturers and assistants of SoftUni). How nice does this sound</p>
