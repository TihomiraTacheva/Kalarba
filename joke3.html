        <p>An architect, a hooker and a programmer were talking one evening, and somehow, the discussion turned to which profession was the oldest.”Come on, you guys! Everyone knows mine is the oldest profession,” said the hooker.”Ah,” said the architect, “but before your profession existed, there had to be people, and who was there before people?” “What are you getting at, God?” The hooker asked.</p>

        <p>“And was He not the divine architect of the universe?” The architect asked, looking smug.</p>

        <p>The programmer had been silent, but now he spoke up. “And before God took on himself the role of an architect, what was there?”</p>

        <p>“Darkness and chaos,” the hooker said.</p>

        <p>“And who do you think created chaos?” the programmer said.</p>
