            <p>A young Programmer and his Project Manager board a train headed through the mountains on its way to Wichita. They can find no place to sit except             for two seats right across the aisle from a young woman and her grandmother. After a while, it is obvious that the young woman and the young                     programmer are interested in each other, because they are giving each other looks. Soon the train passes into a tunnel and it is pitch black. There               is a sound of a kiss followed by the sound of a slap.</p>

            <p>When the train emerges from the tunnel, the four sit there without saying a word. The grandmother is thinking to herself, “It was very brash for               that young man to kiss my granddaughter, but I’m glad she slapped him.”</p>

            <p>The Project manager is sitting there thinking, “I didn’t know the young tech was brave enough to kiss the girl, but I wish she hadn’t missed him               when she slapped me!”</p>

            <p>The young woman was sitting and thinking, “I’m glad the guy kissed me, but I wish my grandmother had not slapped him!”</p>

            <p>The young programmer sat there with a satisfied smile on his face. He thought to himself, “Life is good. How often does a guy have the chance to               kiss a beautiful girl and slap his Project manager all at the same time!”</p>
